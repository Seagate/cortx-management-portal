   ### Preboarding
   
   **Before you begin:** To proceed with login and create your administrator account, navigate to http://<hostname>:<port>/#/preboarding/welcome.
   
   :page_with_curl: **Note:** You can create the admin user only once during setting up the system. The admin user has all the permissions in the system. 
   
   <details>
   <summary>You must log in with the admin user and password to continue onboarding configuration.</summary>
   <p>

   </p>
   </details>
   
   ### Onboarding
   
   To start using the CORTX-Management-Portal, you'll need to complete the onboarding process. 
   
   <details>
   <summary>The onboarding process lets you set up the system and configure the following.</summary>
   <p>
   
   [1	Upload SSL certificate](#1-Upload-SSL-certificate)
   [2	Configure DNS resolver settings](#2-Configure-DNS-resolver-settings)
   [3	Configure network time protocol settings](#3-Configure-network-time-protocol-settings)
   [4	Configure notifications](#4-Configure-notifications)
   [5	Verify  onboarding  configurations](#5-Verify- onboarding-configurations)
   
   #### 1. Upload SSL certificate
   
   A SSL certificate is used on a https connection to encrypt the communication from a S3 Client or your web browser to CORTX Manager. By default, the CORTX Manager uses a CORTX    Manager provided self-signed certificate. Alternatively, you can upload a user-provided self-signed certificate or a user provided certificate authority (CA) signed  certificate. This step can be done during onboarding or afterwards.
  
   To upload SSL certificate:
   
   1. Click Choose File to browse and select the appropriate SSL certificate, and then click Upload certificate. 
   2. Click Continue to open the Management network settings page. 

   #### 2. Configure DNS resolver settings
   
   To configure DNS resolver settings:
   
   1. On the DNS resolver settings page, enter values for DNS Server and Search Domain.
   2. Click Apply and Continue to open the Network time protocol (NTP) page.
   
   #### 3. Configure network time protocol
   
   CORTX and any S3 Clients must be time synchronized via a NTP server. CORTX Manager allows the setting of the NTP server address and a time zone. The time zone on CORTX Manager does not have to match the S3 Client(s). Once the CORTX Manager setting is applied, the setting is then configured on both servers in CORTX. 
   
   To configure network time protocol:
   
   1. On the Network time protocol (NTP) page, enter NTP server address and select the time zone. 
   2. The selected time zone is used by the system.
      - Click Apply and Continue to open the Notifications settings tab.

   #### 4. Configure notifications
   
   The system offers you to configure notifications. You can configure the system to receive notification via email using the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). Once configured, you can receive notifications about any system updates or alerts. You have an option to skip configuring the notifications but it is not recommended. It is recommended to configure at least one email to receive system notification. 
   
   Table 4: Supported and unsupported email configurations lists the supported and unsupported email configurations.
   
   | **Type** | **Supported/Unsupported** |
   |-	|-	|
   | By encryption: | |
   | No encryption | Supported |
   | SSL/TLS | Supported |
   | STARTTLS | Supported | 
   | By authentication: | |
   | SMTP servers which support/require authentication | Supported |
   | SMTP servers which do not support authentication | Not supported |
   
   To configure notifications:
   
   From the Notifications page, select the Email check box, and then click Continue.
   
      1. Enter values for SMTP server, Sender email, Protocol, SMTP port, Sender password, and Confirm password.
      2. In the Receiver email addresses, you can enter multiple email addresses separated by comma (,).
      3. Click Send test email to verify the email configuration. If you do not receive test email on the configured email addresses then check the email configuration.
      4. Click Apply and Continue to open the Summary page.

   #### Verify onboarding configuration
   
   The Summary page displays all the onboarding configurations. You can verify the configurations and if required, go back to a page to change the configurations. After
   verifying the configurations, the system moves to the new IP address added during the configuration. You must use the new IP address to access the system.
   
   To verify the configurations:
   
   - Review the configurations, and then click Continue.
   
   The Confirmation pop-up displays the new IP address of the system. You must use the new IP address to access the system.
